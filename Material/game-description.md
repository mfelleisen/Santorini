# The Rules of Santorini

Santorini is a two-player game. Each player controls two workers, which
move around on a board and add floors to multi-story buildings on the
board. A worker may move from a spot to the top of a neighboring building. 
The first player to get one of his/her workers to the third floor of a
building wins. 

## Game Elements 

- a square board of 36 fields 
- two distinct workers per player 
- an unlimited supply of buildings
   that can grow in height up to FOUR floors 
   at which point they are capped 

## Starting the Game 

- The players take turns to place their workers on the board.
- The oldest player starts. 
- The four workers must end up on distinct fields. 

## Playing a Turn 

The players take turns.  If it is a player's turn, he/she must (1) move one
of his/her workers and (2) place the ground floor/add a floor to a
neighboring building after the move.

A player can move to a neighboring place if 
  - there is no other player on that field, 
  - he/she is "jumping" down from a building (of arbitrary height), or
  - the building on this place is only one step taller than the one he/she
    is on.

A player can add a level to a neighboring field if the building isn't
already four stories tall. 

## The End 

The game ends

- if player A's token reaches the third level of a building.
- if player A can't move or, after the move, can't build up a building.
