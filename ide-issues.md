### DrRacket issues during development 

- I used Emacs because I could make a wide screen, split the buffer
  vertically, and compare and contrast two classes w/o resorting to two
  windows.  


- When coverage is on, drracket turns off compilation caching. 
  While I appreciate coverage a lot, the lack of pre-compiled files is an
  extreme drag. 


- raco test signals exceptions when error-output goes to /dev/null, 
  but drracket doesn't
